- **Enterprises** seeking a self-hosted Snowflake alternative with full data control  

## Getting Started

Databend offers quick local and production deployments:

1. **Run with Docker**:

   ```bash
   docker pull datafuselabs/databend
   docker run --net=host datafuselabs/databend
   ```

2. **Build from Source (Rust 1.77+)**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/databendlabs/databend.git
   cd databend
   ./scripts/setup/dev_setup.sh   # install deps
   make build release
   ./target/release/databend-meta & ./target/release/databend-query
   ```

Extensive docs, Slack community and sample notebooks make setup and exploration straightforward even for first-time users.
